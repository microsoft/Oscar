# VinVL: Revisiting Visual Representations in Vision-Language Models  
## Updates
05/28/2020: Released finetuned models on downstream tasks, please check [MODEL_ZOO.md](MODEL_ZOO.md). <br/>
05/15/2020: Released pretrained models, datasets, and code for downstream tasks finetuning. <br/>
01/13/2021: our new work [VinVL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00529) proposed OSCAR+, an improved version of OSCAR, and provided a better object-attribute detection model to extract features for V+L tasks. The VinVL work achieved SOTA performance on all seven V+L tasks here. Please stay tuned for the model and code release. <br/>
03/08/2021: Oscar+ pretraining code released, please check the last section in [VinVL_MODEL_ZOO.md](VinVL_MODEL_ZOO.md). All image features and model checkpoints in VinVL are also released. Please check [VinVL](https://github.com/pzzhang/VinVL) for details. <br/>
04/13/2021: Our [Scene Graph Benchmark Repo](https://github.com/microsoft/scene_graph_benchmark) has been released. Welcome to use the code there to extract image features with VinVL pretrained models. <br/>


## Introduction
This repository contains source code necessary to reproduce the results presented in the paper [Oscar: Object-Semantics Aligned Pre-training for Vision-Language Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06165).
We propose a new cross-modal pre-training method **Oscar** (Object-Semantics Aligned Pre-training). It leverages **object tags** detected in images as anchor points to significantly ease the learning of image-text alignments. We pre-train Oscar on the public corpus of 6.5 million text-image pairs, and fine-tune it on downstream tasks, creating new state-of-the-arts on six well-established vision-language understanding and generation tasks. For more on this project, see the [Microsoft Research Blog post](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/objects-are-the-secret-key-to-revealing-the-world-between-vision-and-language/).
